STAR3D: a stack-based RNA 3D structural alignment tool

STAR3D is implemented by using java 1.7 and can be executed in 64-bit 
Linux. Two java packages, "commons-cli-1.2.jar" and "EJML-core-0.26.jar", 
are used in the program to support argument parsing and efficient 
matrix computation.  Two programs, "MC-Annotate" and "RemovePseudoknots", 
are used for base pairing annotation and pseudo-knots removal. 
"Apache ant" is required to compile the source code.


* Requirement
Apache ant: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

For Linux system, ant can be installed directly by using command line.
Debian/Ubuntu: "apt-get install ant"
Fedora/CentOS: "yum install ant"

The two jar files and two programs have been already included into 
the package.

Notice: RemovePseudoknots in the "tool" directory is compiled with 
GNU libc 2.12 in Linux. (The version of libc can be checked with "ldd --version".) 
If RemovePseudoknots can not work (*.npk.ct files can not be generated), 
please update the GNU lib in Linux or recompile RNAstructure in your system. 
RNAstructure can be downloaded at "http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html".


* Installation
Go to the STAR3D home directory and execute "ant jar".
(The users can also clean the compiled files by executing "ant clean")


* Preprocessing
STAR3D downloads PDB files and preprocesses them to retrieve the 
secondary structural information.

Go to the STAR3D home directory and execute 
"java -cp STAR3D.jar Preprocess [PDB ID] [Chain ID]".

Notice: Make sure the fold "tools" and file "STAR3D.jar" in the same directory. 


* Structural Alignment
Go to the STAR3D home directory and execute 
"java -jar STAR3D.jar [PDB1 ID] [Chain1 ID] [PDB2 ID] [Chain2 ID]"
More options for the program can be seen by executing 
"java -jar STAR3D.jar -h"

Notice: Make sure the folds "PDB", "STAR3D_struct_info" and the file "STAR3D.jar" 
in the same directory. 


* Show superimposition in pymol
Make sure "PyMOL" is installed in the system.

1. Execute STAR3D with "-p" option to generate the PDB file for the 
alignment.
2. Open pymol
3. Import ShowAln module into pymol: 
	execute "run /path/to/script/ShowAln.py" in pymol
4. Show the alignment:
	execute "ShowAln [aln_pdb], [aln_file]" in pymol
	aln_pdb: the PDB file for the alignment.
	aln_file: the alignment file.

Notice: For the alignments of large RNAs such as 16S and 23S rRNAs, it may 
take a while to render the figure.
